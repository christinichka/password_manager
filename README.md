Password Manager app will keep your passwords all in one place so that you can access them if you need them.

Enter a website you want to record your password for, enter your email, then enter the password you'd like to use. If you don't want to come up with a password yourself, hit the generate password button and a password will be generated for you. Once all of the fields are filled out, hit the add button and a screen will pop up to confirm your information. Click to confirm everything is correct. Your information will be saved to a txt file with all of your other passwords.

This project used tkinter, pyperclip, messagebox, JSON.
